    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "__Concept__: The topic of my project relates to the game \"Green Glass Door.\" This game is typically played out-loud and therefore requires multiple people who are willing to play. For this project, I wanted to eliminate the need for multiple players by automating the _Moderator's_ role within the game through a chatbot. The goal of this project is to create a 1-player version of \"Green Glass Door\" where the game's Moderator is regulated by a chatbot that allows the player to complete the objective of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Description__: Traditionally, \"Green Glass Door\" is a riddle that requires all players to figure out the answer for themselves by analyzing a continuous series of clues. This game only can operate with the presence of two basic components: 1) A player who has already answered the riddle, and 2) A player who has not yet answered the riddle. In this case, the player who has already answered the riddle will provide hints to the other, until he or she is able to make a correct guess. Thus this game may continue indefinitely if the player is unable to solve the riddle because it is against the rules to directly *tell* them the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project turns A3's Chatbot into a version of Green Glass Door that allows new players (who have not yet answered the riddle) to play alone. Specifically, this chatbox seeks to fill the role of the player who has already answered the riddle and is now moderating the game. In response, the user playing the game is meant to fill the remaining role of the player that is making guesses.\n",

    "## How to Play\n",
    "__Players__: 1 user - PLAYER, Chatbot - MODERATOR\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Objective__: The object of the game is to figure out the single rule that dictates what can and cannot go through the GREEN GLASS DOOR.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Instructions__:\n",
    "1. To set-up the game, PLAYER will answer a series of questions asked by the MODERATOR. These questions ask for the PLAYER's name and how much time he or she has to play the game. The length of the game is dictated by the player's choice of 15, 25 or Indefinite chances to guess. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. To start the game, the MODERATOR will provide an example of what can and cannot go through the door. In response, you must make a guess to figure out which objects follow the rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To submit a guess, simply type the object that you are guessing when prompted for an input. The MODERATOR will respond by telling you whether you can or cannot bring your guess through the door.\n",
    "    \n",
    "      Here's an example:\n",
    "        MODERATOR: > What do you want to bring through the door?\n",
    "        PLAYER'S INPUT: cat\n",
    "        MODERATOR: > Sorry! Try again.\n",
    "    \n",
    " \n",
    "4. After every 3 guesses, the MODERATOR will provide another example of what can and cannot go through the door.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You may force-quit the game by typing 'quit' as an input.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. You are given a certain amount of hints, depending on your game dificulty. To use a HINT, type 'hint' as an input. Once you ask for a hint, the total amount of hints that you have will decrease by one. Beware: Asking for a hint is at the cost of losing a chance to make a guess! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__WINNING THE GAME__: If you are able to correctly guess objects that can go through the door _5 consecutive times_, you win the game! At this time, the MODERATOR will display the rule to you. \n",
    "\n",
    "__LOSING THE GAME__: If you run out of chances to guess, you lose the game. This is only applicable if you have a limited number of attempts to guess.\n",
